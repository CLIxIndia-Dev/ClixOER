TISS-COOL
***********

The Connected Open and Online Learning (COOL) is our response to COVID-19 through which we hope to reach out to teachers, teacher educators and students. If you are a teacher in a school or teacher educator or a student  teacher in a Teacher Education Institute (B.Ed./M.Ed.) you will find useful resources for your class and for your own professional development. These resources are available in English and a few modern Indian languages. COOL initiative is seeded by Tata Trusts and supported by Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya National Missions for teachers and teaching (PMMMNMTT).

Connect Open Online Learning - Open Educational Resources (COOL-OER) is a repository of carefully curated OERs that are relevant to Indian context and hence can be adopted/adapted by schools. In times when humongous kinds of resources are being shared on the internet and social media this is an attempt to assist teachers, educators, parents and students find a thoughtfully curated list of open educational resources that can be meaningfully integrated in the teaching-learning process especially during distance learning. The thrust has been to showcase OERs that foster active learning , are multilingual - support Indian languages, accessible and adaptable.

A range of resources - with and without digital technology - and across various types - eBooks, multimedia repositories, simulations, tools, hands-on - have been curated and are available in multiple languages. 

This cool oer repository can be filtered based on the language, domain , education level so on and so forth.
