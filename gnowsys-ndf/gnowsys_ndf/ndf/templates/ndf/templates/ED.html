          Introduction
      </h2>
      <p> 
            The design and development of the CLIx English modules followed a design thinking approach, which  mapped to the six steps of Empathy, Defining a problem, Ideation, Prototyping, Testing and Iteration of the solution. In this case, extensive field research and literature review, along with classroom observations across the four states and discussions with state officials, headmasters and school teachers helped us narrow our focus to Communicative English. The focus was to be on developing listening and speaking skills of students in grades 9-10 in government schools. The baseline survey showed that most students  generally fell within the bands  A1(beginner) -B1 (intermediate) of the Common European Framework (CEFR). This framework was  used as there was no traceable Indian equivalent and it was used only to broadly understand what level the course should be pitched at.

      <h2 class=" back-dd text-center py-1" id="baseline">Baseline </h2>
      <p> An effective resource is well tailored to suit the needs of the target audience. A  dipstick survey was done with a small sample of  students initially in Mizoram, Telangana, Rajasthan and later in Chhattisgarh, between May 2015 and December 2015. Structured as a needs analysis it also included a listening test, a writing task and a set of predefined informal interview questions and read aloud sections (from local textbooks). This was designed to assess the language levels of the learners to assist the  designers in creating resources that would sufficiently challenge the learners and address the gaps in their learning. This dipstick survey was followed-up with a more systematic and rigorous project-wide baseline survey  between July, 2016 to August, 2016, sub-skills within reading, writing, listening and speaking were measured among the learners. The baseline data helped us conclude that our learners largely fell in the A1-B1 band guiding us to create resources which would show progression in our modules along these lines.

                Dastaan fellowship
            
            
            </h2>
            <p> 
                    A short term fellowship was constituted in October 2015 with the objective of understanding our learners better and generating a user profile that would enable designers to create authentic, engaging and culturally relevant content. Titled, DASTAAN which also means ‘a story’ in hindi, it stood for : Develop Bonds with Locals, Ask questions, Study Local Societies, Trace Relations between Socio-Economic Strata and Cultural Practices and Beliefs, Analyse and Assess and Note.  It sought to understand the adolescent’s world(s) through a series of engaging interactions and rigorous research documentation that fellows would facilitate through an immersion in the local school sites in Mizoram, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. It sought to capture background data on teenagers, such as  their linguistic backgrounds, home environment, their likes and dislikes and the students’ learning framework and link with teaching methodology and process. Fellows  collected and recorded information about   students’ interests and their cultural background, the local traditions and practices, heritage and folklore. This was recorded through text, pictures, videos and audio to support the teams in understanding their learners better.

                Desgin camp
            </h2>
            <p> 
                    The first design camp at MIT in August 2015 initiated the team into the design thinking process, enabling designers to come back with concrete ideas on activities or tool types that they had prototyped (paper) and tested. These paper prototypes went on transform into technology-based tools which the team used to create activity and assessment items, within the modules. The design camp also initiated a dynamic working relationship between the teams at TISS and MIT. Weekly calls and discussions between the teams  helped the designers gradually convert their paper prototype into a digital prototype, over a period of 6-9 months. The process of conversion involved intensive collaboration between the domain team, the media team that helped in producing audios, illustrations and videos for the modules and the technology team that built the digital platform and brainstormed on ways of modifying activities to capitalise on the dynamism of the technology enabled learning platform.

            </h2>
            <p>The team considered it important to harness the potential of technology to support language learning and pedagogy. Designers focused on the affordances of technology that complement language learning in a classroom. They also tried to harness the potential of technology to create opportunities for collaboration, autonomy, self-pacing and authentic learning. These determined the design of the platform as well as the ideal classroom set-up within which these digital resources would be used. The field constraints such as  limited computers in classrooms was turned into an opportunity to foster collaboration between students - all activities were designed in such a way that  2-3 learners would have to collaborate in order to complete the learning task at hand. The platform also allows for learners to choose the activities as per their likes  and can make multiple attempts to complete it. Unlike a regular classroom, where the teacher provides feedback to the entire classroom, technology allows for learners to seek specific feedback. This way, they pay more attention to the mistakes they make, and  learn from them.
