        <p>
          Development of the CLIx mathematics modules were guided by the broad
          CLIx objective of introducing an innovative learning space for
          students in Govt. schools with meaningful use of technology, the
          following steps helped us trace ways forward:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            CLIx Mathematics Team started by identifying the topics in high
            school mathematics curriculum that are often perceived as
            challenging by the learners. This task was done by exploring and
            reviewing the existing studies and reports.
          </li>
          <li>
            We explored topics that covered major portion in the high school
            mathematics curriculum. This was done by reviewing the curriculum
            and textbooks used in different states.
          </li>
          <li>
            We conducted informal consultation and discussion with teachers to
            ascertain topics that are seen as challenging to teach using the
            existing teaching resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            We identified areas where technology affordances could be leveraged
            for meaningful use leading to effective learning enhancement. We
            also identified the difficult components of content which needed the
            extra affordances provided by technology, for example, content that
            needs help in visualization, that needs digital construction, that
            allows iterating. Thus, leveraging the use of technology.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="back-dd py-1">
          2. How did we identify what is to be done?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Our approach was to strengthen foundational topic-areas which are
          crucial for understanding high school mathematics. Developing
          geometric reasoning was one of them. Other important areas are
          understanding multiplicative reasoning and understanding equations. It
          is commonly observed that Geometry chapters are often dealt with
          towards the end of the school academic year thereby reducing the
          amount of time and focus available for this theme in general (on
          account of pressure to complete the syllabus and summative
          assessments). Hence, a dedicated focus on geometric reasoning made
          sense from a practical perspective as well. Similarly, strengthening
          of proportional reasoning and its varied applications and making sense
          of linear equations are the other key areas of school mathematics
          which are often not thoroughly built because of which understanding of
          further topic-areas are impeded. Therefore, CLIx Mathematics modules
          attempted to build foundational understanding in these areas by making
          meaningful integration of technology with classroom pedagogy. At the
          outset, following actions points were taken up:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Textbook analysis of high school mathematics curriculum on what
            topics were covered in school geometry - although development of
            foundational understanding of concepts, deductive reasoning, proofs
            and their construction were the long term goals of teaching
            geometry, often these notions and skills were not fully emphasised
            or developed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review of research papers indicated learners’ difficulties and
            errors and ways to tackle them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interaction with teachers in planned workshops and informal
            interactions with them highlighted the practical problems of time
            availability, diversity in classrooms, language, access, learners’
            basic preparedness and so on.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="back-dd py-1">
          3. What informed our approach?
        </h4>
        <p>
          After identifying the mathematical topic-areas to work on, a detailed
          review of the research literature was done which along with the
          following approach informed the development of CLIx Mathematics
          modules.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Design Thinking
        </h5>
        <p>
          The existing research in Geometry and our understanding of the
          learning gaps informed our approach. We decided to start with basic
          concepts in geometry and then gradually move towards justification and
          proofs which are higher order skills. It was decided to adopt a
          blended approach of both hands-on as well as digital tasks in the
          mathematics modules. Design thinking of the digital game and digital
          tasks was initiated at a design camp which was conducted at the
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA in August 2015 for
          preparing prototypes and models. These prototypes were used to conduct
          pilot trials with students to get feedback on the development of the
          digital content. This development activity was iterative in nature and
          feedback was received at various stages of development and changes
          were made. Hands-on and digital tasks design ensured to create
          opportunities for students for multiple explorations and attempts on
          their own. Additionally, to encourage collaborative learning design
          for buddy login, uploading of notes and discussion portals were worked
          out to encourage students to discuss among each other. Teacher’s role
          was envisaged as extremely significant in terms of facilitating the
          classroom discussion.
        </p>
        <h4 class="back-dd py-1">
          4. What informed our design?
        </h4>
        <p>
          We worked closely with the CLIx Technology Team and MIT Design Lab to
          understand the design possibilities and challenges for the content
          under development. Prototypes of the digital activities were tested
          with the students. Based on the feedback, together with the technology
          team, we developed digital prototypes iteratively and again tested
          those with the students. This Design Based Research (DBR) approach
          helped us in modifying our design to make it user-friendly.
          Understanding field realities also played an important role in
          informing our design approach. Understanding the size of the computer
          labs, electricity problems, and other logistical challenges, we
          decided to have digital as well as hands-on activities in our modules.
          Valuing the increasing multilingual character of the modern societies,
          our design approach made provisions for language toggling. Activities
          design was also done by keeping in mind language syntax in different
          languages and to facilitate ways which could have minimal impact
          during language translation.
        </p>
        <h4 class="back-dd py-1">
          5. What did we favour to be our design elements??
        </h4>
        <p>
          e.g., blended form, collaborative approach, making sure students have
          the autonomy, teacher's role
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The math modules were conceptualised to have a blended form valuing
            both digital and hands-on activities which are seen as complements
            to each other. While hands-on activities in the classroom created
            scaffolds for artefact creation and their manipulation by hand,
            digital tasks in computer laboratory were aimed at providing
            multiple opportunities and ways of solving/doing tasks by allowing
            allow students to create, iterate and learn from their own mistakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Considering the small physical spaces available in the computer
            laboratories with limited available computer systems and valuing
            collaborative learning, task design accounted for doing digital
            activities in groups of 2-3 students. Such group work promoted by
            designing buddy logins valued learning from each other and learners’
            autonomy. These aspects are part of the inherent design elements of
            the CLIx Mathematics modules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design elements Leveraging use of technologies which The design of
            the module considers the teacher to be an active participant in the
            classroom. Students’ mistakes provide teachers with the issues to be
            addressed and hence opens up the opportunity to have discussions in
            the classroom to arrive at a shared understanding for particular
            content.
          </li>
          <li>
            The math modules imagine the classroom to be a space to engage in
            the mathematical processes of reasoning, justifying, arguing,
            creating one’s own definition and reaching a consensus by discussing
            with the pairs.

          6. What was the process of ideation?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The process of ideation was an iterative process going back and forth
          on the design thinking as well taking cues from the research
          literature. The design ideas were also discussed with subject experts
          from HBCSE-TIFR, MIT, NIAS. There used to be weekly discussions over
          WebEx with experts from MIT on the design prototypes and furthering
          the plan. Moving ahead, piloting of design prototypes of the digital
          tools with selected students from schools in Mumbai helped the
          ideation process and changes were incorporated based on the review of
          the pilot studies.

          7. What are the things we have learned through this process and how
          did it contribute to the process?
        </h4>
        <p>
          This process of content development brought many new learning
          opportunities for us. One of them is maintaining a balance between
          what do we want to put in the design from a content creators’ point of
          view and what can technology offer (understanding its limitations).
          This helped us to rethink our own visualization of the ideal content.
          Understanding ground realities helped us to strategize implementation
          by suggesting hands-on and digital activities to the teachers. We also
          created students and teachers workbooks so as to enable teachers to
          spend time in the computer lab when a few other students are sitting
          in the classroom engaged with the workbook activities.

        <h4 class="back-dd py-1">
          8. How we tweaked the language and the content that went into the
          teacher's preparation work?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Language translations were prepared by using the exact or same
          Hindi/Telugu terminologies as used in the textbooks for a particular
          state. Proper nouns were used which would be broadly applicable to
          each state’s context. Workshops were conducted where school teachers
          participated for validation of language translation of the modules as
          well as of the teachers’ RTICT courses. Based on the suggestions,
          language use was tweaked.

          9. What are the different artefacts that came out of the process?
        </h4>
        <p >
            &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; During the process of module development, the team created resources
          for students as well as for teachers. Student workbook was created for
          Geometric Reasoning and Proportional Reasoning module in Telugu,
          Hindi, and English. Teachers handbook was developed in Hindi and
          English in order to help teachers to facilitate the module content as
          well as give them opportunities to record their observations and
          reflections.

        <h4 class="back-dd py-1">
                10. What did we imagine the teacher's role in this ??
                
        </h4>
        <p>

In all the three Clix-Mathematics modules, teachers role is central and crucial to the entire process of implementation. The content of the modules was developed by keeping in mind that the students get enough opportunities on their own to explore but at the same time, the teacher plays the role of a facilitator, both in the computer lab as well as in the classroom. Teacher generates classroom discussions and presents challenging questions to the students. The teacher has the autonomy to use the existing tools to go beyond the given activities in the module content and explore other learning opportunities with students.

                11. Also what is unique to our domain (Math domain) e.g game tool, activities,  etc?
                
        </h4>
        <p>
                The unique feature of the math domain content is that it creates an opportunity for students to engage with the math content by providing realistic challenges or context. It allows students to do reasoning with their pair, teacher, and the whole class to arrive at a shared understanding of the mathematical concept. The games, interactives, digital and hands-on activities are designed in such a way that it allows students to learn through iteration and mistakes by having a discussion around it in the class. Along with the pre and post assessment questionnaire for each math module, each of the tools is also collecting a backend data of the user, which can be analysed and researched further to check the efficacy of the module and hence the learning.

            12. Balancing the general and specific things from items

        </h4>
        <p>
            Geometry constitutes a large part of the high school curriculum. In our research, we found that students have many misconceptions in the area of geometry. They rote learn many of the concepts and also proofs. We thought that it is necessary to address this problem by designing a quality material for students and teachers which will enhance teaching-learning processes specifically in Geometry and mathematics, in general. 
            The existing research in Geometry and our understanding of learning gaps informed our approach. We decided to start with basic concepts in geometry and then slowly move towards justification and proofs which are higher order skills. It was decided that the module ‘Geometric Reasoning’ will have hands-on as well as digital components. A design camp was conducted at MIT, Massachusetts in order to prepare prototypes and models in order to develop digital content further. These prototypes were used to conduct trials with students so as to get feedback for going further with the development of digital content. The digital activity development was done using a model in which feedback was received at various stages of development and changes were made accordingly. While designing both hands-on and digital activities it was kept in mind that students get many opportunities to explore and try on their own. Collaborative learning was encouraged by having a design in place which encourages students to discuss among each other. Teachers role was considered as extremely important in terms of facilitating the classroom discussion.
            After the digital content was prepared we tested parts of the module in the schools in different states in India. We received feedback from students and the activities were modified accordingly.
            This process of content development brought many new learning opportunities for us. One of them is maintaining a balance between what do we want to put in the design from a content creator’s point of view and what can technology offer (understanding its limitations). This helped us to rethink our own visualization of the ideal content. We also learned about ground level realities such as space available in the computer lab and electricity problems. This helped us o strategies implementation by suggesting hands-on and digital activities to the teachers. We also created students and teachers workbooks so as to enable teachers to spend tie in the computer lab when a few other students are sitting in the classroom engaged with the workbook activities.
            The teacher's role is considered as a central role in the module implementation. The teacher facilitates the learning of digital and hands-on activities, provides the students with more related examples and link the textbook content with the activities. She also assesses students in order to get inputs on his/her own pedagogy. The modules give opportunities to the teachers
