<p>
CLIx seeks to demonstrate the transformation that the education system needs, as envisioned in the National Curriculum Framework 2005 (NCF 2005). CLIx module content, technology tools and learning platform were created through a rigorous, iterative process of design based research.
<br>
The design and development of CLIx modules have been guided by three pedagogical pillars of collaboration, learning from mistakes and authentic learning. These pillars have proved to be invaluable for designers, students and teachers who implement CLIx. 
<br>
Relevant research literature relating to the topics were drawn upon while creating the contents. Feedback was sought from teacher educators and subject experts from state governments before the contents were authored and reviewed multiple times for quality assurance </p>
