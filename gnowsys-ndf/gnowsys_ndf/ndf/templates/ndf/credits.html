<strong> Contributors:</strong>
We gratefully acknowledge the support received from the <strong> State Governments </strong> of <strong>Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Rajasthan </strong> and <strong> Telangana </strong>, and their dynamic leadership from the state to the districts, blocks, clusters and schools, who have supported CLIx whole heartedly from the start in 2015. We recognise and appreciate the efforts made by school heads and teachers who actively engaged with the CLIx modules and integrated/implemented in their classroom teaching and provided us valuable feedback to improvise the resources before releasing them as OER for the benefit of the wider educational community. <br> 

CLIxOER website is a result of collaborative work between teams at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA USA; and, the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, TIFR, Mumbai, India. The Tata Trusts supported all aspects of the initiative, not only through generously resourcing the work but also engaging with all its aspects in depth and with engagement and shared interest.
