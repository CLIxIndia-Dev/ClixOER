                  As India faces a disruptive moment in education, teachers and
                  students have the challenge of continuing to teach and learn
                  during the lockdown. Technology can be an enabler in this
                  moment of crisis. We, at the Centre for Education Innovation
                  and Action Research, bring to you a wide range of resources to
                  help you continue teaching and learning during this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are committed to offer our expertise and services to help
                  different stakeholders in education transition to other modes
                  of teaching and learning. The <strong> Connected Open and Online
                  Learning </strong> (COOL)  is our response to COVID-19 through which we
                  hope to reach out to teachers, teacher educators and students.
                  If you are a teacher in a school or teacher educator or a
                  student teacher in a Teacher Education Institute (B.Ed./M.Ed.)
                  you will find useful resources for your class and for your own
                  professional development. These resources are available in
                  English and a few modern Indian languages. COOL initiative is
                  seeded by Tata Trusts and supported by Pandit Madan Mohan
                  Malviya National Missions for teachers and teaching
                  (PMMMNMTT).
